# Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming in Java

This repository contains Java programming coursework from a second-level computer science course focused on data structures, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic performance analysis.

## Course Context
**CSC 220 – Computer Programming II**  
This course covers common abstract data types and APIs including lists, priority queues, sets, and maps, along with their efficient implementations using fundamental data structures. Topics also include recursion, sorting algorithms, and experimental analysis of algorithm performance.

## Topics & Skills
- Object-oriented programming in Java
- Lists, sets, maps, and priority queues
- Fundamental data structures and their implementations
- Sorting algorithms and recursion
- Asymptotic analysis and runtime experimentation
- Using APIs in larger software projects

## Repository Structure
- `/Lab01` – `/Lab13` – Progressive lab assignments exploring data structures and algorithms

## Notes
This repository emphasizes correctness, performance, and understanding algorithmic tradeoffs rather than production-level software design.
